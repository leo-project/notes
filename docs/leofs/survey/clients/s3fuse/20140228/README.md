Title
=====
[s3fuse](https://code.google.com/p/s3fuse/) performance test

Purpose
=======
* How many objects can LeoFS store in a directory with reasonable `list_bucket` latency in practice?
* Does the number of total objects stored in LeoFS affect the performance of `list_bucket`?
* Does the number of concurrent requests to LeoFS affect the performance of `list_bucket`?
* Does the number of mount points to LeoFS affect the performance of `list_bucket`?

How to test
===========
Measure the time of `ls` command against a directory storing a specific amount of files with the `time` command.

* Conditions
    * the number of mount points(hereafter called `M`)
    * the number of concurrent requests per a mount point(hereafter called `C`)
    * the number of total objects stored in LeoFS(hereafter called `T`)
    * the number of objects in the target(ls) directory(hereafter called `O`)

* LeoFS cluster information
    * Server: CentOS 6.4
    * LeoFS : 1.0.0-pre3
    * s3fuse: 0.15(https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
    * fuse:   2.8.4
    * consistency: N:3, R:1, D:1, W:2
    * # of servers: G:1, S:5

Results
=======
* M=1, C=1

Conclution
==========
* `s3fuse` achieved the impressive result compared to `s3fs-fuse`. This means `s3fuse` will be replaced where `s3fs-fuse` have been used.
* We recommend limiting `O` under 1,000 in production for now.
* `T` have almost no effect to `ls` performance.
* The result of `M`, `C` means when accessing to LeoFS via s3fuse in parallel, Increasing M lead to boost performance.
